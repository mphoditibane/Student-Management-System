Student Management System

I've created a comprehensive student management system with the following features:

Redux Store Setup

Authentication state management
Profile state management
Proper TypeScript types
Registration System

Form validation with Zod
Error handling
User-friendly feedback
Login System

Email/password authentication
2FA implementation
Protected routes
Dashboard

Student profile overview
Academic progress
Quick actions menu
JSON Server

Mock backend for development
Student and profile data storage
The application is now running with two servers:

Frontend: http://localhost:3000
JSON Server (API): http://localhost:3001
To test the application:

Register a new account
Login with your credentials
Set up 2FA (use code "123456" for testing)
Access the dashboard
The UI is built with shadcn/ui components and styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern, professional look. All forms include proper validation and error handling.
